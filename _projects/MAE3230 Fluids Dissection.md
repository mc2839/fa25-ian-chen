Bike Pump Dissection

In MAE3230, groups of students were tasked investigate a real-world fluid mechanical system, explaining it's operation with core principles from the course. Our group was tasked with dissecting a bike pump, specifically a dual-action bike pump, and to make a video presentation on our dissection with the fluid mechanics of how the system works. 

My focus for this project was to present the intorduction on what specifically a dual-action bike pump is, and how fluid (air) flows through the system during operation. A dual-action pump is designed to deliver air on both the upward and downward strokes of the piston, making it more efficient than a standard single-action pump. 

This introduction sets the foundation for the remaineder of the presentation, where we explain our dissection, analyze fluid mechanics quantitatively, and explain an example calculation.

## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Junior at Cornell University, College of Engineering. I am currently persuing a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, and am passionate about how mechanical design can be used to improve people's lives. On campus, I am on the Mechanical Subteam of the Autonomous Robotic Sailboat Project Team, researching and designing the mechanical structure of robotic sailboats. Outside of academics, I am a part of the Assorted Aces, a dance team on campus.
